# BAIS-Capstone

For my BAIS Capstone project, my team and I developed an engagement score algorithm tailored for the University of Iowa Center for Advancement. The algorithm, designed to assess and enhance constituent engagement, utilized a blend of data analytics and machine learning techniques. Our solution aimed to optimize outreach strategies, foster stronger connections, and encourage philanthropic donations between the university and its engaged community.

Our team utilized softwares such as R, Tableau, and Excel to complete our project. The timeline of this project was one semester long (16 weeks) and within this period we fully cleaned our data, merged our datasets, removed columns, imputed NAs with zero, etc. This entire process led our team to create an effective engagement score algorithm that the University of Iowa Center for Advancement can use to achieve their own business goals.
